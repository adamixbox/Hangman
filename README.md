Like with all my other projects so far, I only just made this small game because I was bored and wanted to practice some Python. This time the game was a bit more
complex than my previous projects I guess. With that extra complexity, my project comes with extra mess! It is really bad and messy but it works I guess... This 
project has a working hangman system with a highscore and etc.
